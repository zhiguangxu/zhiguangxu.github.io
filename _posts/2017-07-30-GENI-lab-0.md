### 1. GENI Portal

> For this lab and all other GENI labs, please use Google Chrome as your Web Browser.
> 
> Also, it is assumed that a GENI project by the name of __CS4121_GENI__ has been created and your account has been added to that project.

- Go to [https://portal.geni.net/](https://portal.geni.net/), click "Use GENI". 

- On the "Choose your school or organization below:" page, type <span style="color:red">__NCSA__</span> in the "Or enter another" box. 

	You have to do this unless your institution is one of those who have joined the _InCommon Federation_. 
	
- Click continue and login to the GENI Portal. 
	
	Note: If you are redirected to a GENI agreement page, just check the boxes that indicate you agree to all policies and to let the portal work on your behalf, then submit the page.
	
- On the GENI Portal homepage, click the _Home_ --> _Projects_ tab, notice that you should see that you have already been added to the project <span style="color:red">__CS4121_GENI__</span>. Click it and enter the project.

### 2. Create SSH Keys

As what you will learn from Section 5 below, in order to accomplish this GENI lab (and all the other GENI labs), you need a command-line based SSH terminal. In order to establish a secure connection between your GENI Portal and terminal, you need to generate __a pair of SSH keys__: a public key which is saved on the GENI Portal and a private key which needs to be downloaded to the terminal.

- Click your name at the top-right corner of the GENI Portal homepage, then SSH Keys.

- Click "generate and download an SSH keypair".

- On the "Generate an SSH private key" page, type a Passphrase, confirm it, and then click "Generate SSH private key". We will come back to this page later in Section 5. 

	> Note: Make sure you understand that the "Passphrase" is not the "Private Key" itself. The passphrase is a phrase that you choose to protect the automatically generated private key.
	
### 3. Create a GENI Slice and Reserve Resources

- Again, go to the homepage of the project <span style="color:red">__CS4121_GENI__</span>, if you are away from it.

- Click "Create Slice", name it "__lab0-your-initial__", and click "Create slice".

- Follow the steps 3.3. and 3.4 in __hands-on-lab0-setup.pdf__ very carefully to reserve some resources at one of the sites whose name contains "InstraGENI". 

	> One of the sites that has been working pretty well for me is "_Standord InstraGENI_".
Note: <span style="color:red">__It might take around 10-15 minutes for both of the nodes that you reserved above to turn green__</span>. If this does not happen after some extensive time, you need to delete all the resources from your slice and try again. Make sure your slice is truly empty before trying again though. You may choose to reuse the same site or try a different one. 
	
The following screenshot shows how your GENI portal should look like once the reservation step is completed.

### 4. GENI Desktop Instrumentization

> Do this following <span style="color:red">__only after__</span> both nodes in the slice you created above have turned green. 

- Click "Tools", then "GENI Desktop".

- If you are asked to authorize GENI Desktop, click "Authorize the GENI Desktop". 

- In the new window, click the GENI logo, then "Authorize". After a moment, a list of all your slices will be displayed (if there are many). Click "CS4121_GENI:lab0-your-initial". 

- If you have not created a Global Node for your slice, GENI Desktop will prompt you to add one. Just click "OK".

- Then continue to wait until your GENI Desktop is fully instrumentized. The following screenshot shows how your GENI Desktop should look like then.

Note: <span style="color:red">__It might take quite some time (as long as half an hour) for all the steps above to complete__</span>.  
	
If you are really out of luck, i.e. it seems that your GENI Desktop never becomes ready even after an extensive amount of wait, you probably need to delete all the GENI resources (make sure they are all gone) and try Sections 3 and 4 above again. Perhaps you want to try a different site.

### 5. SSH Terminal

As mentioned in Section 2 above, you need an SSH terminal and you have the following three choices. __Choose one of them that is the most appropriate for you.__

#### 5.1. Instrumentized GENI Desktop

Assuming that your GENI Desktop has been instrumentized, here is how you get your browser base SSH terminals.

- In the Desktop window, click "SSH".

- Click the "client" node, then "Open Browser tab SSH" (or "Open Browser Window SSH"). 

- If you see a security warning, click "ADVANCED", then "Proceed to .... (unsafe)".

- Do the same to get an SSH terminal for the the "server" node. 

#### 5.2. MacOS or Linux Shell

Since MacOS/Linux machines come with a fully functional terminal, it is very easy to establish a secure connection from your local computer to the GENI Portal.

- Click the "client" node on the GENI slice page for "CS4121_GENI:lab0-your-initial", take notes of the "SSH To" line where url and port number are shown, e.g. `zxu@pc3.instageni.stanford.edu:31802`

- Do the same for the "Server" node.

- Click your name at the top-right corner of the GENI Portal homepage, then SSH Keys.

	- Click __Download Private Key__.

	- Follow the instructions under "On Linux and Mac, open a terminal" to login to the "client" node. Basically,

			cd ~/.ssh 
			
			(if the ~/.ssh folder does not exist, do "mkdir ~/.ssh")
			
			mv ~/Downloads/id_geni_ssh_rsa ~/.ssh/
			
			chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa
			
			ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa [username]@[hostname] -p [port]
			
			(E.g. ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa zxu@pc3.instageni.stanford.edu -p 31802)
			
	- Say "yes" to the prompt "Are you sure you want to continue connecting". 
	
	- Enter your Passphrase if prompted.

	- Run the last command above `ssh -i ...` to login to the "server" node. 

#### 5.3. Windows PuTTY

- Install PuTTY, a free SSH client for Windows: Just download `putty.exe` from [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html ](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

- Click the "client" node on the GENI slice page for "CS4121_GENI:lab0-your-initial", take notes of the "SSH To" line where url and port number are shown, e.g. `zxu@pc3.instageni.stanford.edu:31802`

- Do the same for the "Server" node.

- Click your name at the top-right corner of the GENI Portal homepage, then SSH Keys.

	- Click __Download PuTTY Key__

- Run PuTTY.

	- On the Basic options screen, in the Host Name field enter the url you noted above, e.g. `zxu@pc3.instageni.stanford.edu`
		- In the Port field enter the port number you noted above, e.g. `31802`
		- Make sure Connection type is: SSH
		- Under the settings categories on the left navigate to Connection-> SSH ->Auth.
		- Next to the "Private key file for authentication" field at the bottom, click Browse... and select the PuTTY key file you saved to your computer, and click Open.
		- Click Open to establish the SSH connection.
	   - If prompted about whether you trust the host (key not cached in registry), click Yes.
   	- When prompted for the Passphrase,  enter your Passphrase.

	- If you see the prompt `yourname@client:~$`, you have successfully logged into the "client" node.
	
	- Do the same to log into the "server" node.
